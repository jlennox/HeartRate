Heart rate monitor
==================

A lightweight program to display the heart rate reading from a
[Bluetooth Low Energy device](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/viewer?attributeXmlFile=org.bluetooth.characteristic.heart_rate_measurement.xml).

This has only been tested on a [Polar H7](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007S088F4) (non-referral link) but others should work.

Reportedly working devices include:
* Polar H7, Polar OH1, Polar 10
* Coospo HRM
* Magene H64

Requires Windows 8.1 or newer.

The executable and code are released under MIT license.

Code can be built using [Visual Studio Community 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).

Motivation
----------
I owned a Polar H7 I could not get to work with any iOS software for use in the
gym. I decided to repurpose it as a way to read my heartrate while I worked on
the computer. I create my own due to lack of available software.

The program's secondary purpose is for Twitch streamers. After looking
into streamer setups I saw an excessive mix of hardware and software was needed.
I am not a Twitch streamer but **I am willing to add the customizations needed
by request.**

How to use
----------
1. Connect appropriate bluetooth device inside Window's bluetooth settings.
2. [Download prebuilt binaries](https://github.com/jlennox/HeartRate/releases) or build from source.
3. Run HeartRate.exe

I do not have the time to turn this into production grade software but I am
willing to expand it to your needs. At startup, the program searches for an
appropriate device and attempts to register a notification event for
`heart_rate_measurement`. If this fails, the error is likely vague and not overly
helpful. If you believe your device should work with this software but does
not, please open a github issue with specifics.

This will not work for any general USB/bluetooth heart rate monitor. It has to
be a Bluetooth Low Energy device supporting `heart_rate_measurement`.

By default, only an icon in the system tray is displayed. When the heart rate
goes over an alert threshold, a balloon notification shows.

Clicking the system tray icon reveals a window with scaling text. This is for
Twitch streamers to be able to region for broadcast.

Settings
--------
Most settings are exposed in the UI through a context menu by right clicking the
main window or the system tray icon. The rest can be accessed by editing the XML
settings file directly.

*Options not inside the UI*
Right clicking the system tray icon gives the option to edit an XML settings
file. When the editor is closed, the settings will be reloaded automatically.
The file is `%appdata%\HeartRate\settings.xml`

| Setting    | Type | Default  | Description |
|------------|------|----------|-------------|
| `Sizable` | bool | true | If the window is a normal sizable window. `false` looks better but is not recognized by OBS as a window. |
| `LogFormat` | text | csv | The format to write to the LogFile. Only "csv" is valid. |
| `LogDateFormat` | text | OA | The format to write the date column as. See `Datetime formatting.` |
| `LogFile` | text | *empty* | The full path of where to write the logged data to. If empty, no file log is kept. A `%date%` token can be included to substitute in the date. A custom formatter can be included, such as `%date:MM-dd-yyyy%` Example: `C:\users\joe\desktop\heartrate-%date%.csv`  |
| `IBIFile` | text | *empty* | The full path of where to write the IBI data to. Writes log of RR-Intervals in milliseconds in IBI supported file format. Supports date syntax like `LogFile` does. |
| `HeartRateFile` | text | *empty* | The full path of where to write the last heart rate to. Anything previously in the file is overwritten. Only the the most present heart rate will exist in the file. Supports date syntax like `LogFile` does. |
| `AlertLevel` | number | 65 | The heart rate to display a system tray notification balloon at. 0 to disable. |
| `WarnLevel` | number | 70 | The heart rate to use `WarnColor` at. 0 to disable. |
| `AlertTimeout` | number | 120000 | The amount of milliseconds to cooldown for being able to show an alert after one was shown. |
| `DisconnectedTimeout` | number | 10000 | The amount of milliseconds after disconnecting to await for a valid device connection before displaying "X" |
| `UDP` | host:port | *empty* | A UDP end point to write the "LogFile" output to. Format is `ip:port`, ie: `<UDP>127.0.0.1:2115</UDP>` |

*Settings also exposed by the UI*

| Setting    | Type | Default  | Description |
|------------|------|----------|-------------|
| `FontName` | text | Arial | The font name for the system tray icon. |
| `UIFontName` | text | Arial | The font name for the window display. |
| `UIFontStyle` | text | Regular | The font style for the window. Multiple styles can be specified by comma separation. `Regular`, `Bold`, `Italic`, `Underline`, `Strikeout`. |
| `UITextAlignment` | text | MiddleCenter | The alignment of the text in the UI. Can be `TopLeft`, `TopCenter`, `TopRight`, `MiddleLeft`, `MiddleCenter`, `MiddleRight`, `BottomLeft`, `BottomCenter`, `BottomRight`. |
| `Color` | color | FFADD8E6 | The default color for the system tray icon. |
| `WarnColor` | color | FFFF0000 | The system tray icon color once `WarnLevel` has been met. |
| `UIColor` | color | FF00008B | The default color for the window display. |
| `UIWarnColor` | color | FFFF0000 | The window display color once `WarnLevel` has been met. |
| `UIBackgroundColor` | color | 00FFFFFF | The background color for the window display. |
| `UIBackgroundFile` | text | *empty* | The full path of a background image. |
| `UIBackgroundLayout` | text | Stretch | The background image display layout. Possible values: `None`, `Tile`, `Center`, `Stretch`, and `Zoom`. [More information.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.imagelayout) |
| `UIFontUseSize` | bool | false | Should the size in `UIFontSize` or selected from the Font dialog be used. If `false`, the font size scales automatically with the window. |
| `UIFontSize` | number | 20 | The size of the font if `UIFontUseSize` is `true`. |
| `UIWindowSizeX`/`UIWindowSizeY` | number | 350/250 | The saved window size. This is automatically saved when resizing. |

`color` values are formatted as 32bit ARGB hex values. Leading 0's are optional.

### Datetime formatting
Datetime formatting is done using the standard C# syntax. One special exception
is "OA" which will convert to an "OLE Automation Date" formatted date, which is
useful for Excel.

The default `LogFile` date formatter is `yyyy-MM-dd hh-mm tt`. The timestamp
is taken at the startup time of the program.

Notice on deployment
--------
Some builds of Windows 10 have bug related to security which causes Desktop
apps to stop receiving notification callbacks from GATT characteristics after
receiving a few initial callbacks. [More details available](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/58da3fdb-a0e1-4161-8af3-778b6839f4e1/)
or in similar posts on social.msdn.microsoft.com.

There are several workarounds, the simplest being creating an AppId for the app in
the Windows Registry and adding a security setting for the AppId, like below:

```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\AppID\{C6BFD646-3DF0-4DE5-B7AF-5FFFACB844A5}]
"AccessPermission"=hex:01,00,04,80,9c,00,00,00,ac,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,14,00,\
  00,00,02,00,88,00,06,00,00,00,00,00,14,00,07,00,00,00,01,01,00,00,00,00,00,\
  05,0a,00,00,00,00,00,14,00,03,00,00,00,01,01,00,00,00,00,00,05,12,00,00,00,\
  00,00,18,00,07,00,00,00,01,02,00,00,00,00,00,05,20,00,00,00,20,02,00,00,00,\

  00,01,01,00,00,00,00,00,05,14,00,00,00,01,02,00,00,00,00,00,05,20,00,00,00,\
  20,02,00,00,01,02,00,00,00,00,00,05,20,00,00,00,20,02,00,00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\AppID\YOURAPP.exe]
"AppID"="{C6BFD646-3DF0-4DE5-B7AF-5FFFACB844A5}"
```

Wanting to remain lightweight and not having an installer, this is not handled
automatically by the program.
